no-stack-cli
============

Tools for stack generation from templates and an api.

## Getting Started
If you are ever confused about the commands, run `nostack --help`. 
If you want to know the parameters for any command, just run the command with '--help'.
But relax--if you are missing one you will be told.  :) 

The four standard steps for creating an app are the following:
1. create a no-stack-app `nostack newapp -a <appName>`
2. create a new moderator and stack `nostack quickstarter -e <moderatorEmail> -w <password> -l <licenceId>  -u <moderatorName> -s <stackName>`
3. spin up stack (call from the same directory as step 1): `nostack spinstack -u <moderatorName> -t dir/to/template/<templateFile> -s <stackName> -e <emailFor Moderator>`
4. generate code (call from the same directory as step 1): `nostack makecode -a <appName>`

The first step by far takes the most time.  Not only does it call create-react-app,
but it installs every dependency, which can take 10 minutes.  Therefore, a 5 second alternative
is to specify an `appBase`, which is a locally stored empty no-stack app.  You can specify it
with the `-b` flag: `ns newapp -a app${currentNumber} -b ${appBase}`.

The best practice is usually to create one initially by calling this:
```
appBase=~/path/to/appbase
ns newapp -a ${appBase}
```
Then you can call it as you like.  The drawback of using an appBase is that if any of the
dependencies change you will not see the changes.

There is also a recommended shortcut command to get started:
`nostack quickStarter -e ${email} -w ${password} -l ${license}  -u ${moderator} -s ${stackName} -a${appName} -t ${appTemplate} -b ${appBase}`


That will give you everything you need for your first app.  Note that
you will need to provide a license and a template.  You can apply for a license at www.nostack.net. Documentation for
creating templates is in the pipeline right now.

The test directory contains a few sample templates in /test/testData/.

## NoStack Concepts
It is useful to understand two things:
1. NoStack stores types of data and their instances.  Instances contain an
  autogenerated id and a value.  For instance, you might have in your application a type
`restaurant` and it may have 300 instances, each of which has a name and
an autogenerated id.
2. types are declared and used in "sources".  A source is fundamentally
a hierarchy of types.  For instance, a source might contain at its
root restaurant, with cuisine and rating as children.

Also, every source is assigned to a given user class, and a generated
server has auth built in.

More details are given in the "Creating Templates" section below.

## Creating Templates

The templates are text files which contain series of declarations
 using the NoStack Flow Specification language (NFS).  

An template file treats each line as a different declaration.
Any line that does not begin with a reserved command word is ignored.

### NFS Commands
The commands are expected to change soon, but currently these are available:
* newUserClass \<class\>
* newSource  \<source\> \<class\>
* newType \<type\> \<source\> \<parent\> \[\<data type> ] \[\<association type>] 
* newSelection \<source> \<selected type>
* newConstraint \<constraint value> \<source> \<type> ID|Value
* connectSources \<childSource\> \<parentSource\> \<connecting type\>

## Command Explanations
*newUserClass* A user class is a type of user.  A source is an interface unit that
is permitted to a user class.  A source contains a hierarchy of
types, starting from some root type.  A source also can include
actions that can be performed with data.

Types are loosely data entities and/or properties.  A type
declaration contains the name of the type and a parent type.
\[Important note: a user class declaration also results in a 
type being created for the user class.  In other words, each
user is an instance of their class or classes.] By default,
a type is a string.  But optionally a type can be set.  
Currently, only booleans and strings are supported, but that
will change soon.  

A type declaration can also optionally 
contain a association type.  Association types can specify whether 
a child is required for the parent (always exists) or not,
and the number of children for a type.  The default is not 
required and multiple.  Currently, the only declarable
association type is singleRequired, which is useful for 
declaring properties.

A selection means a type in a source that gets returned to 
the front end.  It is analagous to a field that shows up in 
the "SELECT" clause of an SQL query.

A constraint limits the data returned. A source and the type
  to be constrained must be specified.  Also, a constraint value
  is required.  That is normally a variable name which can
  then be set in front end code.  There are two types of
  costraints: ID and Value.  Constraining by id returns the
  instance having the id specified.  Constraining by value
  will return any instances that satisfy the condition
  provided.
  There are a few reserved words for constraints.  The main
  one is __currentUser__, which is the id for the current user.
  If you set the constraint value to __currentUser__, then
  the code generated will set it as such.  Otherwise, it's 
  just a string used for a variable name that gets set in
  the code. \[Note: the name that you give for the constraint
  value for an ID contraint is purely for code readability.]
  
Two sources can be "connected", which will affect frontend
code generated.  A connecting type must be shared between the
sources.  Usually, a connecting type will be a constrained
 type for the child source.  When a source A is connected to parent source
B, a component generated for B will contain A as a subcomponent
with an instance for every instance of the connecting type.

## `nostack callapi`

Make a call to the nostack api. Takes care of auth for the user. You need to specify a file with the graphql query and another one with a json of the variables, if anyare used.

```
USAGE
  $ nostack callapi

OPTIONS
  -h, --help                         show CLI help
  -q, --queryFile=queryFile          graphql file containing a single query
  -s, --stack=stack                  stack
  -u, --user=user                    moderator for stack
  -v, --variablesFile=variablesFile  json file with query variables

EXAMPLE
  $ nostack callapi -u irnold1y -s TestStack1y -q ~/projects/no-stack-queries/queries/unitData1y.graphql -v 
  ~/projects/no-stack-queries/variables/unitData1y.json
```

## `nostack createstack`

Creates a new moderator and stack.  Also logs in the moderator locally.

```
USAGE
  $ nostack createstack

  -f, --force
  -h, --help                 show CLI help
  -l, --licenseId=licenseId  license id for the organization of the user
  -s, --stack=stack          stack
  -u, --user=user            moderator to create
  -w, --password=password    moderator password

EXAMPLE
  $ nostack createStack -u franky -s tempstack, -e franky@gmail.com -w franky12$
```

_See code: [src/commands/createstack.ts](https://github.com/YizYah/no-stack-cli/blob/v0.1.0/src/commands/createstack.ts)_

## `nostack help [COMMAND]`

display help for nostack

```
USAGE
  $ nostack help [COMMAND]

ARGUMENTS
  COMMAND  command to show help for

OPTIONS
  --all  see all commands in CLI
```

_See code: [@oclif/plugin-help](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-help/blob/v2.2.1/src/commands/help.ts)_

## `nostack makecode`

generates a starter app from a json provided by NoStack

```
USAGE

## `nostack newapp`

create an empty new no-stack app.  Effectively combines create-react-app with apollo stuff and the no stack package.

```
USAGE
  $ nostack newapp

OPTIONS
  -a, --appName=appName  name of application
  -b, --baseApp=baseApp  directory of the base app to copy. If it does not exist, it is created.

## `nostack quickstarter`

Creates a new moderator and stack.  Also logs in the moderator locally.

```
USAGE
  $ nostack quickstarter

OPTIONS
  -a, --appName=appName      name of application
  -b, --baseApp=baseApp      directory of the base app to copy. If it does not exist, it is created.
  -e, --email=email          moderator email
  -f, --force
  -h, --help                 show CLI help

## `nostack spinstack`

Spins up a fully functional backend from a provided template.  The same template can then be used to generate front end code using the command 'makeCode'.

```
USAGE
